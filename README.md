> Observe [the rule](https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/copyright/inputs): Do not publicly share your puzzle input (and likewise do not ask others to share their puzzle inputs). Do not commit your puzzle input into your repo or at least not do not share the input publicly; use `.gitignore` or equivalent.
